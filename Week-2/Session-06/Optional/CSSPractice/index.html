				Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my
				database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.

			<div>
				Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And
				there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so
				suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.
			</div>
			<div class="orange">
				Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

			<div class="orangeRed">
				Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my
				data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
